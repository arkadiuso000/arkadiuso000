# 👋 Hi, I’m @arkadiuso000

Hello there! I'm Arek, and I'm excited to share a little about myself with you.

## 👀 About Me

I come from the beautiful country of Poland. Currently, I'm a student of Computer Science at Lodz University of Technology, where I'm following my passion for technology and its applications. I'm very interested in exploring new technologies, especially things like wearables and the Internet of Things (IoT). Besides technology, I'm also enthusiastic about promoting a healthy lifestyle and I have a strong interest in bodybuilding. Additionally, I find AI and Machine Learning fascinating, and I enjoy learning about these topics.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

Right now, I'm focused on the world of programming and app development. I'm diving deep into Swift, as I have a special liking for Apple products. Apart from Swift, I'm familiar with languages like C++ and Python, which have broadened my programming knowledge. I'm also starting to learn about AI and Machine Learning, as I'm curious to contribute to advancements in this field.

## 💞️ Collaboration

I'm always open to working together on interesting projects that match my interests. If you're involved in anything related to wearables, IoT, app development, AI, Machine Learning, or any other exciting tech areas, feel free to get in touch. Let's join forces to make a positive impact!
